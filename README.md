# Laboratory taken at the University Politehnica of Bucharest for analysing medical images

## Lab 2: playing with python functionalities for changing a picture's properties by manipulating different data types

### Transformed RGB image to grayscale image using the rgb2gri function

### Same as earlier, but with more complicated colors (turqoise) obtained by multiplying each planes matrix (RGB) with corresponding RGB coefficients for tuqoise (0.15R 0.78G 0.82B - #26C7D1 in Hex)
